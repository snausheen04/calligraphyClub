		<p>This page is aimed at bringing calligraphy lovers in the Bay area together. If you're someone who loves Calligrpahy too, hop on & register!</p>
		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>Being a full-time Computer Science student and a part-time Intern at Tech company can sometimes be overwhelming. After a week full of assignments and deadlines, calligrpahy is something that I look forward to over the weekend. As they say, art can be healing, I decided to connect with people who also love doing calligraphy in their free time and share their art.</p>
		<h2>Opportunities</h2>
		<p>To keep the momentum going, there's going to be a bunch of activites, for beginners too!</p>
